              <p>Ladies and gentlemen of the Internet, this isn't easy. But here we are, starting at a static page together.</p>
              <p>What's going on?</p>
              <p>Spokepoint is done. Finished. Finito. Departed. Jogged our last mile. Cooked our last bird. Tweeted our last 140. Filtered our last photo. Pourover'd our last cup. Burritoed our last...burrito. Veni, vidi, sort of vici.</p>
              <p>As of August 31 2015, we've closed up shop. As of August 31 2035, the robots control us all.</p>
              <p>It's been an awesome ride. We've learned a ton from building with our customers, including how much faith people put in you if you work hard and deliver for them. Now we're moving forward with these lessons.</p>
